# Marvel Characters
This app consumes [Marvel's API](https://developer.marvel.com) for listing characters and showing their picture and description

For being able to run this app, you will need to generate your Marvel API private and public keys and replace their respective placeholders in the `com.bergamin.marvelcharacters.data.api.MarvelInterceptor` class.

Unit tests currently cover the data mapper and model classes
